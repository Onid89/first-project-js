    synopsis:
      'Georges Bizetâ€™s "Carmen" features one of operaâ€™s most captivating heroines. Carmen\'s character is multifaceted: ' +
      'she can be seen as a seductress, a symbol of forbidden yearning, an anarchist, or a seer of her own fate who fears nothing. ' +
      'This versatility makes her a mirror reflecting societal norms. Bizet challenged Romantic opera with a naturalistic portrayal ' +
      "of a proletarian world filled with poverty and crime, contrasting sharply with conventional opera settings. Don JosÃ©'s obsession " +
      'with Carmen leads him into a spiral of misery and crime, away from a stable life with MicaÃ«la. The bullfighting scene epitomizes ' +
      'the clash between feminine and masculine, bourgeois and anarchist principles, symbolizing a brutal survival of the fittest.',

    synopsis:
      'Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Lorenzo da Ponte\'s "Don Giovanni" is based on the Spanish legend of Don Juan. ' +
      'This opera, their second collaboration after "Le Nozze di Figaro," elevated Don Giovanni to mythical status, ' +
      'inspiring numerous interpretations and philosophical analyses by figures like E.T.A. Hoffmann and SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard. ' +
      'The opera is renowned for its memorable musical pieces, including arias, the famous overture, and various ensembles. ' +
      "The story begins with Don Giovanni's womanizing career well underway. His valet, Leporello, notes that Giovanni has seduced " +
      '1,003 women in Spain alone. Despite the risks, Giovanni continues his pursuits. After being caught with Donna Anna, he kills ' +
      'her father in a duel and flees. He is then pursued by Anna, her fiancÃ© Don Ottavio, and his former lover Donna Elvira. ' +
      "His next target is Zerlina, whom he attempts to seduce on her wedding day. Giovanni's relentless provocations lead him to his inevitable downfall.",

    date: 'September 07',
    time: '19:00 Uhr',

    theater: 'Staatsoper Unter den Linden',
    synopsis:
      'The wealthy Count Almaviva has won the heart of the beautiful Rosina under the pseudonym Â»LindoroÂ«. But Rosinaâ€™s jealous guardian Dr Bartolo wishes to marry his ward himself and so tries to keep her suitors away. Fortunately, Â»LindoroÂ« is helped by the cunning barber Figaro, who â€“ more or less ingeniously â€“ weaves a web of entanglements and masquerades. The 23-year-old Rossini composed Â»Il barbiere di SivigliaÂ« in just three weeks. Witty, fiery and vibrant, it is a masterpiece of Italian opera buffa, in which, as is so often the case, the old man in disguise hoodwinks everyone. Rossini was inspired by the 1772 play Â»La PrÃ©caution inutile ou le Barbier de SÃ©villeÂ« by the French poet, secret agent and arms smuggler Pierre-Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais, which tells the backstory of Mozartâ€™s Â»Le nozze di FigaroÂ«. Rossiniâ€™s humorously drawn characters, the brilliant solo parts, rousing melodies and fast-paced ensembles fully unfold in Ruth Berghausâ€™s timeless production from 1968 (with young Achim Freyerâ€™s innovatively simple stage design). Bursting with life and situation comedy, it has lost nothing of its youthful freshness and vitality after over 350 performances.',

    date: 'September 08',
    time: '19:00 Uhr',
    price: 15,
    theater: 'Deutsche Oper Berlin',
    synopsis:
      'Gustave Flaubertâ€™s novel "Madame Bovary," published in 1856, is a seminal work in world literature that contributed to the rise of modernism. The story centers on Emma Bovary, a young country woman dissatisfied with her mundane provincial life and unambitious husband. Longing for passion and luxury, she engages in extramarital affairs and accumulates massive debts, ultimately leading to her tragic downfall and suicide. The term "Bovarism," derived from Emma Bovaryâ€™s character, describes a condition where one escapes reality through excessive fantasies.Christian Spuckâ€™s ballet adaptation of "Madame Bovary" for the Staatsballett Berlin eschews traditional narrative forms in favor of abstract choreography and psychological exploration. This production delves into themes of female self-determination, escapism, and the catastrophic merging of fantasy with reality, using poetic imagery and refined humor to bring the characters inner worlds to life through dance.',
