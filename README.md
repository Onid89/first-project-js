# first-project-js

**First idea**
1- Create a list with all the Opera houses in Berlin.
2- Create a list with all the operas that will be staged this week with date and start time.
3- there are too many operas available to watch this week , so we leave it up to chance with a randoom choice based on our day and time availability.
